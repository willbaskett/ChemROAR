# ChemROAR
A novel generative embedding architecture for clustering and generating drug molecules. Finds heirarchical clusters of molecules with specific properties and then generates new molecules using those clusters. Allows for the generation of molecules arbitrary properties without additional model training.

# ChemROAR finds clusters of molecules which inhibit HIV replication
