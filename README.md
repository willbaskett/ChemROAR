# ChemROAR
A novel generative embedding architecture for clustering and generating drug molecules. Finds heirarchical clusters of molecules with specific properties and then generates new molecules using those clusters. Allows for the generation of molecules arbitrary properties without additional model training.

ChemROAR is a transformer based autoencoder that generates a heirarchical binary embedding which naturally clusters data. It uses a Random Order AutoRegressive (ROAR) decoder to learn complex dependencies between SMILES sequences and other molecular properties in the dataset. It was trained on PubChem10m.

ROAR models are capable of modeling mixed-type data, allowing seamless integration of SMILES sequences with tabular molecular properties during training. Each token input in a ROAR model consists of a Type, Position, Value triplit. This format allows multiple data modalities to be included in the same context without any architectural considerations and without requiring an impractically large model vocabulary. Random order modeling forces ChemROAR to learn to predict molecular properties given SMILES sequences and vice versa. As autoregressive models they also remain capable of generative modeling.

ChemROAR combines an encoder which produces heirarchical discrete embeddings and a random order decoder. This forces the model to learn to hierarchically cluster molecules based on high-level  similarities. Higher-level clusters are less specific and contain more molecules. Lower-level clusters are more specifc and contain fewer molecules. Each cluster is well defined and contains a specific number of molecules. This allows us to use conventional statistics to quantify uncertainty about the properties of each cluster and provide a confidence interval. This means that we can generate new drug molecules and have a well defined idea of how likely they are to do what we want.
